## Contributing

This repo is built with [`lerna`](https://lerna.js.org/) on top of [`yarn` workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

You can use each modlue in `packages/*` as a standalone application with `yarn` most of the time simply by `cd`-ing into its directory.

Formatting and linting rules are enforced by git hooks, so your commit will be blocked in case any of the files is non-compliant.
